## 🎯 Objective

Coordinate and deliver onboarding sessions for accepted technical volunteers. These sessions will help new contributors understand the community, their role, the tools in use, and the expectations — ensuring a smooth transition into active participation.

Sessions may be conducted live (via video call) or asynchronously (via Discord/Notion threads), depending on availability.
