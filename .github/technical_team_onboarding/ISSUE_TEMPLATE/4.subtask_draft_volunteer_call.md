## 🎯 Objective

Craft and distribute a clear and compelling call for volunteers to invite applications for the upcoming Rust Cameroon technical volunteer onboarding cycle. This call will describe the initiative, available roles, requirements, and how to apply.

This may be a **private call**, **referral-based**, or **selectively public** depending on internal strategy.
