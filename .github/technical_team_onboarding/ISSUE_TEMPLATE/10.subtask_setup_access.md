## 🎯 Objective

Provision appropriate access and permissions for each onboarded volunteer across all platforms used in the program — including Discord (for communication), Notion (for planning), and GitHub (for contributions).

This step ensures every volunteer is properly integrated into the tools and spaces where the team collaborates.
