## 🎯 Objective

Assign each volunteer (or group of volunteers) a dedicated management team lead who will serve as their primary point of contact, guide them through the onboarding phase, and provide long-term support and check-ins.

This creates structure, accountability, and a more human-centered experience for new contributors.
